# AI Health Guardian – Post-Surgery Recovery Support

## Project Overview
**Post-Surgery Recovery Support** is the first core use case of **AI Health Guardian**, designed to help patients achieve safer, more effective post-operative recovery. By integrating patient health data (surgery records, recovery logs, wearable device data) with AI reasoning, the system provides **personalized recovery guidance, proactive risk alerts, and enhanced doctor-patient communication support**.

---

## Problem Statement
Post-surgery recovery is a high-risk phase; patients often lack personalized guidance, while doctors have limited time for continuous follow-up. Up to 30% of patients experience suboptimal recovery or complications, increasing readmissions, costs, and stress. Traditional follow-ups cannot scale effectively, leaving gaps in monitoring and timely intervention. There is an opportunity to leverage AI and multimodal data to provide tailored recovery guidance and alerts, extending expert-level care to every patient.

## Solution
- **Multimodal Data Integration**: wearable signals, recovery logs, medical records, imaging reports, and patient-reported symptoms.  
- **Multi-Agent System**:
  - **Data Collector Agent** – gathers wearables, app, and hospital data.  
  - **Health Interpreter Agent** – analyzes patient metrics using medical knowledge.  
  - **Recovery Guide Agent** – generates personalized daily recovery plans.  
  - **Risk Alert Agent** – detects anomalies and triggers alerts.  
  - **Doctor Collaboration Agent** – creates concise recovery summaries for clinicians.

## MVP Scope
1. Daily health data collection and AI-generated personalized feedback.  
2. Intelligent anomaly detection and proactive alerts.  
3. Visualized recovery progress dashboard for patients.  
4. Doctor-side recovery summary reports.

## Technical Implementation
- **Data Pipeline**: Data ingestion → Vectorized storage → Multi-agent reasoning → Recommendations & alerts → Patient app & doctor dashboard.  
- **Tech Stack**:
  - Azure OpenAI (reasoning & summarization)  
  - Azure Health Data Services (FHIR data management)  
  - Azure Cognitive Services (speech & imaging analysis)  
  - Wearable APIs (Apple Health, Fitbit, Garmin, etc.)  

---

## Value Proposition
- **Patients**: Expert-level personalized guidance, improved safety, and recovery outcomes.  
- **Doctors**: Reduced follow-up workload, faster anomaly detection.  
- **Hospitals & Payers**: Lower complication rates and readmission costs.  
- **Healthcare Ecosystem**: Continuous recovery data loops enabling AI-driven standardization.
